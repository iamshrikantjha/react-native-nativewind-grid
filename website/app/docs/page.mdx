# Introduction

Welcome to **Standard Grid for React Native** (NativeWind Grid).

This library brings the full power of CSS Grid Layout to React Native, designed to work seamlessly with [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/). It allows you to build complex, 2-dimensional layouts with the same ease and syntax as web development.

## Why use this library?

React Native's layout system is based on Flexbox. While Flexbox is excellent for 1-dimensional layouts (rows or columns), it becomes difficult to manage when you need 2-dimensional control (rows AND columns simultaneously).

**NativeWind Grid** solves this by implementing a custom layout engine that parses standard Tailwind CSS Grid classes helping you build:

- **Bento Grids**: Complex dashboard layouts with spanning items.
- **Masonry Layouts**: Pinterest-style dynamic columns.
- **Responsive Grids**: Adapts to different screen sizes easily.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Standard Grid**: `grid-cols-N`, `gap-N`, `gap-x/y-N`
- ✅ **Complex Tracks**: `grid-cols-[100px_1fr_auto]`
- ✅ **Grid Areas**: Named areas like `header`, `sidebar`, `main`
- ✅ **Masonry**: True masonry support
- ✅ **Virtualization**: `<VirtualGrid />` for high-performance large lists
- ✅ **Subgrid**: Visual inheritance for nested grids
- ✅ **Alignment**: Full support for `justify-items`, `place-items`, etc.
