# Grid Template Rows

Utilities for specifying the rows in a grid layout.

## Usage

Use `grid-rows-{n}` to create a grid with `n` equally sized rows. This is primarily useful when you want to constrain the grid to a specific height and divide it vertically.

```tsx
/* A 200px tall grid divided into 2 equal rows */
<Grid className="h-[200px] grid-rows-2 grid-flow-col gap-4">
  <View className="bg-pink-200">01</View>
  <View className="bg-pink-200">02</View>
  <View className="bg-pink-200">03</View>
</Grid>
```

## Explicit Height Required

Unlike the web where `grid-rows` can imply content restrictions, in React Native you typically need to ensure the container has a defined height (via `h-{value}` or `flex-1`) for `grid-rows` to effectively split that available space.
